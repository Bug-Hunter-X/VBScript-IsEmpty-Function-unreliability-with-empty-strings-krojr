This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to the IsEmpty function and its interaction with empty strings. The primary issue stems from IsEmpty's broad definition of 'empty' and its failure to discriminate effectively between an empty string and other empty-like values. This inconsistency often leads to unexpected results in functions that expect explicit handling of empty strings.
